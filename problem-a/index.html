    Shawn Spencer is a fictional character in the hit show 
    <a href="https://psychusa.fandom.com/wiki/Shawn_Spencer">Psych.</a>
    He co-owns a  psychic detective agency with his childhood best friend, 
    Burton Guster. Despite not having any psychic abilities, Shawn poses 
    as a psychic due to his powers of observation. He employs this 
    skill to assist the Santa Barbara Police 
    Department in solving various cases.
